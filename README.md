# team-profile-generator

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to design a program in which I could generate a team profile using node. I built this project to demonstrate my capabilites in node as well as jest and inquirer. This solves the problem of generating a new webpage for each new team that is designed. I learned through building this project how to run tests using jest. How to use contructors and pass objects.
## Installation
 
 You need to install node to have the program work, additionally you will also need inquirer. Jest also needs to be installed to run the test files. Once you have all of the necessary packages, you can then run the program by typing in node index.js into the terminal and follow the prompt when asked about the necessary team members.
